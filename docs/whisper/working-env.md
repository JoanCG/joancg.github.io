## Â· ðŸ¤— Repositories
In order to create and mange ðŸ¤— Repositories (datasets, for example) we need to install the huggingface_hub CLI and run the login command. Following [ðŸ¤— Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-getting-started), this can be done by just running these commands on our conda environment: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli login
```

The `huggingface-cli login` command will ask us for a token, which is automatically generated in our account. We only have to follow the clear instructions that appear on the terminal. 


## Â· ðŸ¤— Datasets library
Before we start creating our flamenco audio dataset, we need to setup the environment and install the appropriate packages. [Hugging Face (ðŸ¤—) Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets.  It works on Python 3.7+. We will follow the [installation instructions](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation) provided in the ðŸ¤— docs. 

We go for the `conda` option and install it on our whisper environment using:

```bash
conda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets
```
